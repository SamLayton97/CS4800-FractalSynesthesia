# CS4800-FractalSynesthesia
Fractal Synesthesia is a program which uses fractals' trait of self-similarity to visualize both the immediate and developmental changes of a given song. When users launch the program, an underlying fractal tree begins to generate. As it grows, an algorithmic analysis of the user-selected song adjusts the color of currently growing branches and the tint of the grass below to reflect the mood of the song's moment. And as the tree branches, the program determines the structure of the next branch generation using values calculated over an entire movement, thus capturing the song's development. This results in a tree that is both unique to and representative of the song's growth and character.

To launch Fractal Synesthesia, perform the following steps:
 * Download, unzip, and open the FractalSynesthesia program folder.
 * Run FractalSynesthesia.exe.

## Importing Custom Songs
While the base program includes a *royalty-free* song to visualize, Fractal Synesthesia allows users to import their own songs. To do so, perform the following steps:
1. Download, unzip, and open the FractalSynesthesia program folder.
2. Navigate to the FractalSynesthesia>FractalSynesthesia_Data>StreamingAssets folder.
3. If this folder does not exist, create a folder named StreamingAssets under FractalSynesthesia_Data.
4. Ensure that the custom songs are either in a .wav or .ogg format. NOTE: There are plenty of online resources to convert .mp3 sound files to .wav or .ogg. Here's a good one: https://audio.online-convert.com/convert-to-wav
5. Move or copy the custom songs in to the StreamingAssets folder.
6. Run FractalSynesthesia.exe. The custom songs should appear in the song selection window.

## Selecting Songs
With multiple songs imported and playable by the program, users can play different songs using the selection window.
 * Press Tab to open and close this window.
 * Click on the buttons to play their corresponding songs.
 * Toggle the "Auto Play" option to automatically play the next song in the selection when the current one ends.
 * Toggle the "Shuffle" option to automatically play a random song in the selection when the current one ends.
 
## Closing the Application
To gracefully close Fractal Synesthesia, press the ESC key.
